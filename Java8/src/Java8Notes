From Imperative to Functional and declarative style of programming.


Imperative  - We tell what and how to do - step by step

Functional - is declarative - We tell what to do but not how to do
	- We let the underlying libraries to take care of what to do
	- Work with higher order functions - pass function to function
	- Return function from function
	- We create function from  function
	- We can focus more on getting our work done 
	- Function composition

Honoring Immutability - 
Pure function - function's with no side effect
	When u call a function it produces an output only depending on the input
	
	
Why Functional wayâ€¦??
	- Concise - easy to see and understand
	- Code becomes more expressive
	- Less code - fewer lines of code
	- Easy to modify
	- Fewer bugs
	- Effortless to parallelize and make it efficient.

	- Functional Interfaces
	- Single Abstract Method Interfaces
	- IntStream.range(0,10) - method given in Java 8

Streams:

- Streams are extreamly lazy evaluation until actually needed
- Stream Operations:
    eg:: filter, reduce, map, findfirst, order by, reverse, limit, sorted
